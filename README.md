## üìã Features

- Asks the user how many NPCs they would like to generate
- Asks the user what they want the NPC names to be
- Generates 15 other attributes for each NPC

## üìú Overview

The NPC Generator was created for a school project, and generates NPCs with attributes such as age, height, weight, strength, IQ, race, personality, occupation, the sport they play, their favorite specific float, if they are related to Gerald, if they play ROBLOX, if they are in the thick of it, if they are eamon, and how they like their cheese. This can be used for any project that may need NPCs (or just characters in general), wether it be a video game, artwork, or a book. This is capable of making hundreds of different NPCs developers can use in their projects, allowing the user to chose what names the NPCs will have.

## Specifications

The "race", "personality", "occupation", and "sport" variables are chosen from four [lists](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lists.asp). Below shows the three lists in the code. 

```python
# Defines 3 lists full of atributes
potential_race = ["American Indian/Alaska Native", "Asian, Black", "African American", "Native Hawaiian", "Pacific Islander", "White, African", "Caribbean",
"Indian", "Melanesian", "Australasian/Aboriginal", "Chinese", "Guamanian", "Japanese", "Korean", "Polynesian", "European/Anglo Saxon", "Other Pacific Islander", "Latin American",
"Arabic", "Vietnamese", "Micronesian"]

"Electrician", "Chemist", "Film Director", "Public Relations Specialist", "Event Planner", "Software Engineer",
"Entrepreneur", "Logistician", "Quality Control Inspector", "Speech Therapist", "Urban Planner", "Biologist"]
potential_sport = ["Basketball", "Soccer", "Tennis", "Baseball", "Football", "Hockey", "Volleyball", "Golf", "Rugby", "Cricket",
"Swimming", "Athletics", "Cycling", "Table Tennis", "Badminton", "Gymnastics", "Wrestling", "Boxing", "Martial Arts", "Surfing",
"Skateboarding", "Snowboarding", "Rock Climbing", "Rowing", "Skiing", "Lacrosse", "Field Hockey", "Fencing", "Handball", "Softball",
"Rugby Sevens", "Ultimate Frisbee", "Diving", "Sailing", "Canoeing", "Triathlon", "Motor Racing", "Horse Racing", "Snooker", "Darts",
"Water Polo", "Billiards", "Archery", "Powerlifting", "Weightlifting", "CrossFit", "Pilates", "Yoga", "Cheerleading", "Cricket",

```

The "geraldrelation", "inthethickofit", and "eamon" variables all use [.find](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_string_find.asp) to figure out if the name contains "Gerald" (geraldrelation), "KSI" (inthethickofit), and "Eamon" (eamon).

```python
geraldrelation = name.find("Gerald")
    if geraldrelation == -1:
        geraldrelation == False
    else:
        geraldrelation == True
        
    inthethickofit = name.find("KSI")
    if inthethickofit == -1:
        inthethickofit == False
    else:
        inthethickofit == True
        
    eamon = name.find("Eamon")
    if eamon == -1:
        eamon == False
    else:
        eamon == True    
```

If the name does contain the certain word, the variable will be the index of where the word appears. If it is not there, the varialbe will be -1 as the world never shows up. We can then change the variable to False if it is equal to -1 and true if otherwise.

Me, "Stegss" who likes learning to code. I've found Python very interesting so far, and this project was pretty fun to make.

Here is an example of an NPC output if the user asked for 1 NPC and inputed the name "Stegss":

```python
